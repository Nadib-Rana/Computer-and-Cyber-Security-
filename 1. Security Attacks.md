 #### Security Attack:
 ```
 Any action that compromises the security of information owned by an organization.
Ther have two types:
  1. Passive Attack.
  2. Active Attack. 
  ```
#### 1. Passive Attack:
```
This kind of attack , attackers can only read messages and monitoring the traffic.
There have two types:
1. Eavesdropping: This involves intercepting and listening to communications,
such as reading unencrypted emails or capturing data packets transmitted over a network.

2. Traffic Analysis: This involves analyzing patterns in communication (like timing,
 frequency, and volume) to infer information about the data being transmitted, even if the content is encrypted.
```

#### Active attacks:

```
 Active attacks involve attempts to alter, disrupt, or destroy data or services.
 They can be more noticeable and harmful than passive attacks. Key types include:

1. Modification: Altering data during transmission (e.g., man-in-the-middle attacks).

2. Denial of Service (DoS): Overloading a system to make it unavailable to users.

3. Masquerading: Pretending to be a legitimate user to gain unauthorized access.

4. Replay Attack: Intercepting and re-sending valid data transmissions to trick systems.

5. Session Hijacking: Taking control of a user session after authentication.

```
