May be incorporated into appropriate protocol layer in order to provite some of the OSI security services.
i. Encipherment:
      Ecipherment is the process of converting plaintext (readable data) into ciphertext
      (unreadable data) using a cryptographic algorithm. This process is also known as encryption.
ii. Digital signature:
     Digital signatures are cryptographic mechanisms used to verify the authenticity, integrity,
    and non-repudiation of digital data.
iii. Access control:
     Access control is a security mechanism that restricts access to resources based on a user's identity and privileges.
     It helps to protect sensitive information and systems from unauthorized access.
iv. Data Integrity
v. Authorization Exchange:
       uthorization exchange is a process that involves the exchange of security tokens or
       credentials between parties to establish trust and grant access to resources.
       It is a fundamental component of many modern security systems
vi. Traffic padding:
     It is a technique used in computer networks to artificially increase the amount of data transmitted between two points.
vi. Routing Control:
   Routing control is the process of managing the path that data packets take as they travel through a network.
   It involves determining the best route for packets to reach their destination, based on factors such as network topology,
    traffic congestion, and policy rules.

**1. Specific Mechanisms and Their Integration into OSI Layers**

The specific security mechanisms listed in the prompt can be incorporated into various layers of the OSI model to provide the corresponding OSI security services:

| Security Mechanism | OSI Layer | Security Service |
|---|---|---|
| Encipherment | Presentation | Confidentiality, Integrity |
| Digital Signature | Application | Data Integrity, Non-repudiation, Authentication |
| Access Control | Application | Authentication, Authorization |
| Data Integrity | Presentation/Application | Data Integrity |
| Authorization Exchange | Application | Authentication, Authorization |
| Traffic Padding | Network | Confidentiality, Availability |
| Routing Control | Network | Availability, Confidentiality (indirectly) |
